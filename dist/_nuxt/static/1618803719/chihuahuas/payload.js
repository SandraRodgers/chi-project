He needs to stay at an ideal weight so there is not extra pressure on his knees. Tanner has a handsome tan coat with white highlights. Being a puppy, Tanner would enjoy another small dog to grow up with. He may do fine as an only dog as long as the family is around a lot and can give him a great deal of attention. Tanner also needs a family who can check on him every 4-6 hours (would not be a good fit for a family that works 10-12 hour days). Tanner would be great in a home where there was a great deal of activity and people were home a lot. Because of his high energy level, we do not feel he is apartment appropriate. Note that he does like to explore. Because of his small size, he must never be left unattended in the backyard and the yard must have a secure, wooden fence (no wrought iron and no chain link – he can get through these).
