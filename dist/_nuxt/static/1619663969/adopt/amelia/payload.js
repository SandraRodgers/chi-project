Amelia’s human Dad had not been heard from for several days. The family asked that the local law enforcement do a welfare check on him. Sadly, they found the gentleman passed away, and 11 Chihuahuas in his home. His family lived far away and could not take care of the Chihuahuas so they surrendered them to the local animal shelter. That shelter then reached out to our Chihuahua Rescue & Transport Southeast Chapter to see if CRT would help. We agreed to take all 11 Chihuahuas. Four of them stayed with the SE region (in North Carolina). Our dedicated volunteers then transported the other 7 from North Carolina to Dallas. Amelia was a part of the group that came to Dallas to find her new forever home. We are so happy we said “yes” – she has been a delight."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"df2d94b14fb9",_type:b,children:[{_key:"9a7c3d13ba610",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Amelia has a mellow, laid back personality. Amelia gets along well with the other small dogs in her foster home. She immediately fit into the pack in her foster home. She has a perfect lady-like personality, very polite. She enjoys being in the same area as other dogs, but prefers her own soft dog bed and will supervise the activity! She is past the “playing” stage so does not play much with other dogs or with toys. She loves going out in the backyard and exploring the yard.

Due to her smaller frame and laid back personality, she might fit best in an all adult home. She loves people, but we think quick movements and noise from children will scare her.

We have a video of her “sitting” on TikTok and it has been seen over 10 million times in the first 48 hours (you heard us right – 10 million fans!). She currently sleeps in bed with her foster family. She is not a big fan of crates and will cry when crated.
