He has had a few accidents in the house, but this has gotten better as time has gone by. He is a well-behaved boy and listens to verbal corrections. If he is unsure of a situation, he can become a little anxious but is easily reassured. Because he has the potential to be a “door darter,” Rio is crated when his foster mom leaves the house. And while he is fine being crated if his foster mom is at home, he will howl for quite a while when his mom leaves. For this reason he is not apartment appropriate. As he has become accustomed to being crated when his foster mom leaves, the howling has lessened some.

Because of his small size, he must never be left unattended in the backyard and the yard must have a secure, wooden fence (no wrought iron and no chain link). His ideal home would be calm and moderately active, with a family who spends a lot of time at home. A work at home family would be perfect! Rio does not bark a lot, but will if he hears a noise or the other dogs bark.
