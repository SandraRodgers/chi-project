She had no collar, no tags and no microchip. Her owners never stepped forward to claim her. Penny spent the next month at The Colony Animal Shelter. She was frightened and just wanted to stay in the back of her cage area, alone. The shelter staff was very understanding – who wouldn’t be nervous being around all those barking dogs! They reached out to CRT to see if we would bring Penny into our program and help her get ready for a forever home. We are so happy we said “yes” – she has been a delight."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"6fa820187c6e",_type:b,children:[{_key:"5d4c4ee6119a0",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Penny has a mellow, laid back personality. Penny gets along well with the other small dogs in her foster home. She immediately fit into the pack in her foster home. She has a perfect lady-like personality, very polite. She enjoys being in the same area as other dogs, but prefers her own soft dog bed and will supervise the activity! Penny also gets along with cats. She is past the “playing” stage so does not play much with other dogs or with toys. She enjoys going outside and laying in the sun. And she enjoys hanging around the other dogs to make sure she does not miss any adventures. Note that Penny is afraid of larger dogs and would not be a good fit in a home with dogs over 10 pounds."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"b8564adc2480",_type:b,children:[{_key:"9a8d3cac47410",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Penny loves her people.

She loves to press her body into yours as she wants to be as close to you as possible. It is as if she is almost hugging you. When you come home from errands, she gives you an adorable “I missed you so much” look!

Penny enjoys snuggling in a doggie bed in your office while you are working on emails and participating in conference calls. She would be perfect for a work-at-home family or a retired family. Penny is a bit shy when she meets new people, but warms up fairly quickly. She does exhibit anxiety and cries when her family leaves home to run errands, so we do not recommend an apartment setting. We highly recommend a family that is home a great deal of time so that she will feel comfortable and relaxed."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"d90c995ba3c2",_type:b,children:[{_key:"37d5944afb420",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Penny is about 5 years old.

She has had three seizures, about a month apart. Each has lasted about 1 – 2 minutes. Our vet has prescribed phenobarbital, a low cost medicine (about $15 a month) to help control her seizures. Our vet told us that dogs with an epilepsy condition often develop this right around Penny’s age. They also told us that these dogs can live for long periods of time with the proper medicine and a healthy diet. We are looking for a forever family for Penny that is familiar with this medical condition, and who will be committed to keeping her on track with medicine and care."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"c684b62a259b",_type:b,children:[{_key:"264225f0b2ee0",_type:a,marks:[],text:"The perfect home for Penny would be one with moderate energy.
