From the moment they stepped into their foster home, they acted like they had always been there. They had no anxiety or nervousness at all. Stella and Tucker get along well with the other small dogs in their foster home. They enjoy playing with their siblings. Stella and Tucker also enjoy toys. They enjoy toys of all kinds, but their favorite is the tug-of-war rope. They will play and play with it. They also enjoy it when their human throws toys to them. They will run to get them and bring them back for another round. Stella and Tucker enjoy being out in the backyard. This spring weather is allowing them more trips outside where they show their joy by running crazy 8’s in the yard! When these siblings are done playing, they crash for a nap. You can often find them snuggled together in the same bed with their heads laying on each other!"}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"1e7cf0f3eb93",_type:b,children:[{_key:"941970ba71250",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Stella and Tucker love their family.
