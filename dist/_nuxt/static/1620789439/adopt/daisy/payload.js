She has been with CRT since May of 2019. You heard that right – over a year in our foster program. Daisy was found as a stray by Burleson Animal Services. She was shy and frightened, and BAS knew her best chance would be with a rescue where she could feel safe, begin to gain confidence, and grow. So BAS reached out to CRT and asked us to bring this girl into our program. We were happy to do so, and have been amazed at this girl’s progress. She is now ready for the next phase of her life – a life filled with love and happiness."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"f32c02c5206d",_type:b,children:[{_key:"3e5291ca632b0",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Daisy tolerates the other small dogs in her foster home.

She will take some extra patience while she works up the courage to let you pet her. Once she gets comfortable with you, Daisy is a big snuggler.
