A sweet lady came to their rescue, scooped them up, brought them home and they began growing up together. We were contacted about a month ago by the owner. She unfortunately has a critical illness herself and is about to move into a hospice situation. One of her biggest concerns was making sure Batman and Robin were taken care of the rest of their lives. We immediately agreed to bring them into our program and our volunteer team made the 10 hour round trip to Houston to bring them to Dallas. They are very bonded. Batman and Robin are a great duo, and we are committed to finding a forever home where they can stay together. We wish their original owner all the best as she battles her illness."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"c1b5582645de",_type:b,children:[{_key:"69c77c2927f30",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Batman and Robin are happy dogs. They get along well with the other small dog in their foster home. They enjoy playing together and will run and romp through the house and outdoors. There is a cat in their foster home and they get along with the cat. They are curious and interested in the cat. Sometimes they will bark a little at the cat, but so far there has been no chasing! Batman and Robin also enjoy toys. Their favorite is the rope toy. They love to play tug of war with each other. And often they will both grab an end of the rope and run through the yard in unison with the rope in their mouths! They also love ball toys. Batman and Robin enjoy being out in the backyard. This spring weather is allowing them more trips outside where they show their joy by running crazy 8’s in the yard! When these siblings are done playing, they crash for a nap. You can often find them snuggled together in the same bed with their heads laying on each other!"}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"51cff91715a6",_type:b,children:[{_key:"4c47bfffabb00",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Batman and Robin love their family. When they first arrived, they were a bit shy. We can all understand that since they had only lived in one home since they were 4 weeks old! But they warmed up within about 24 hours and are now the biggest love bugs! They love to hang with you in whatever room you are in so they don’t miss any family fun. When you are ready to relax, they are ready too. They both love to cuddle. They will both climb up on top of you and share your love. They are often intertwined on their foster Daddy’s lap! They also love to be on his chest! They just melt when they are with you. This warms our hearts so much. Note that sometimes as they are following you around, they can get close to your feet, and thus be a tripping hazard."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"8d9e70f01e01",_type:b,children:[{_key:"714483460c240",_type:a,marks:[],text:"Both Batman and Robin are super smart.
