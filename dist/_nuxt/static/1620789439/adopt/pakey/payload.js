All three CRT regions joined together for a rescue mission the first weekend of August. After hundreds of miles and hours of driving, all 22 Chihuahua were safe in CRT foster homes around the country. Pakey was one of these dogs.

She loves to go outside and lay in the sun. Sometimes she will go out to potty, feel the warm sun and just relax in the yard with the sun on her back and the breeze in her face. It makes her so happy!

She is the consummate lap dog. Pakey wants to be with you all the time and will happily spend hours in your lap as you watch TV together. She is extremely well behaved and will do anything to make her family happy. She is not mischievous at all! She has the cutest habit we want to share with you. When she is sitting on your lap, she tilts her head back and looks at you with a specific look as if to say “I adore you”. You are her angel, and she expresses that to you every day.

Pakey gets lonely when she is left alone (which we can all understand since she grew up in a home with 21 doggy siblings!). She does not like to be crated for long periods of time while you are gone. For this reason, we believe an ideal home would be one with a work at home family or retired family. She enjoys laying in a doggy bed in the home office while her Mom works from home.

She would probably be fine as an only dog too as long as her family spent lots of time with her. There are no children in her foster home. We think that due to her age, personality and size, she would do best in an all adult home or a home with older, mature children (13 and older). The ideal home for Pakey would be one that was laid back with moderate activity. Oh we also think she might like car rides! She keeps following her Mom out into the garage (don’t worry – garage door is closed) and wants to get into the car with her! So we are going to take her for some car rides to see how she does. She might be a little road warrior! We will update her bio when we figure this out. Pakey is a fairly quiet dog.

We are working with her on going potty outside and she is transitioning well. Pakey will sleep in her crate at night. We mentioned earlier that she is not fond of a crate, but at night, she goes into the crate by her foster Mom’s bed and goes right to sleep. If she can see you and knows you are in the room with her, she is fine. She just does not like to be in the crate when you leave the house. It makes her lonely. We have recently noticed that she gets a little nervous during storms. Her foster Mom has been working on her with this, and will give you advice on how to comfort her."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"426a94357fbf",_type:a,children:[{_key:"7f6186eb2ea80",_type:b,marks:[],text:"Pakey is being fostered in the DFW area.
