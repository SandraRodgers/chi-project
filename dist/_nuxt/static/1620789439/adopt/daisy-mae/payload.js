The first is exploring. The fact that I’m blind doesn’t stop me a bit! I love to wander through the house (my foster mom made sure it was safe for me) and investigate the fenced backyard. Then it’s time to move on to my second passion, napping! I have perfected the art of making myself the coziest nest. I’m not sharing my secret, but it involves lots of digging and covering myself completely with blankets! I’m a sweet old soul and, while I’m not a snuggler, I enjoy a few pats and kisses and will always respond with a friendly wag when you say my name."}],markDefs:[],style:c},{_key:"d4abb9c44dfb",_type:b,children:[{_key:"b914d805bfd20",_type:a,marks:[],text:"I’m doing well for a girl my age, but I do have some health concerns. I suffered a bad bout of constipation when I first came to the rescue, so I need to stick to my current diet, Hill’s Science Diet canned puppy food. I can’t hold it quite as long as I used to, so I need to be carried outside or to my potty pad every few hours to prevent messes. My foster mom keeps me in a bassinet lined with puppy pads and washable blankets to help keep messes manageable. The vet also found some masses in my uterus during my spay surgery, so I’ll need to be monitored in case they’re cancerous. She said I have a heart murmur too, but I don’t need any medications.
