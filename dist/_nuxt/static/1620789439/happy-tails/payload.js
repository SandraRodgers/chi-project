He's working on following basic commands such as sit and come. He's definitely chosen me as his favorite person because I'm his mommy but he loves to snuggle with Daddy too, especially in the morning. He loves his Mexican blanket more than anything (he went crazy when we gave it to him, rubbing his face in it and enjoying the texture) and his mini tennis ball (and he still loves the duck). His favorite thing is snuggling in my lap. He can't do that enough. Our favorite thing about him is his gentle nature... He is playful and loving.
